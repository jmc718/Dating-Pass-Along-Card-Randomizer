# Overview

So I have this friend (_totally_ my friend-- not me at all I don't know what you're talking about) who has a hard time asking out girls. I figure, if he only had something to help him out maybe he could finally get somewhere. Like, say, a card he can pull out of his pocket and give it to someone before his nerves get the best of him. Every card will be different. So each card will contain an invitation, some contact info, and some references to things that he likes mixed in with the rest. Certain fields will have a wide variety of lines that could potentially go there, and the ones that end up there will be totally randomized. 

It all starts with a template for the cards in Microsoft Word. The structure of each card will be the same, so there just needs to be some place holders where a random word or phrase from the list can be inserted. This can be done using, you guessed it, a program. 

Here's a video of how the software functions.

# Development Environment

The template was, of course, created in Microsoft Word. All of the magic to make something of that template on the other hand was done in Python. I used Visual Studio Code as my IDE and used the following libraries:
- docx
- docxtpl
- random
